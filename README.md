# Anki-Flashcards-Year-1

Here you can find my decks for year-1 modules. They are all **apkg** files. To import them just launch anki and choose **import file** at the bottom.

They will start with easy stuff from the early weeks and will go onto harder questions.

Keep in mind that most of the decks are 60% to 80% done. You can easily add more cards to the deck by clicking *add* and choosing the deck. If you decide to add more cards or spot a mistake, please message me on Discord or create a pull request! All contributions are greatly appreciated.
