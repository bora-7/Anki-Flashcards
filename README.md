# Anki-Flashcards

Here you can find my decks for year-1 and year-2 modules. They are all **apkg** files. To import them just launch anki and choose **import file** at the bottom.

They will start with easy stuff from the early weeks and will go onto harder questions.

Keep in mind that most of the year-1 decks are 60% to 80% done. You can easily add more cards to the deck by clicking *add* and choosing the deck. If you decide to add more cards or spot a mistake, please message me on Discord or create a pull request! All contributions are greatly appreciated.

Software engineering deck is divided into 4 subdecks, to represent the 4 questions in the exam. I recommend having a pen and paper while going through each subdeck and taking notes as you answer questions.
